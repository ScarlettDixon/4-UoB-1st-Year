# 4-UoB-1st-Year
Code and other information from the first and only year of a MSc Cyber Security degree at the University of Birmingham

Student ID: 1675746

**Modules Taken:**

Cryptology - Initially taught the differences between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography before going into detail on the structures of historical and modern encryption techniques within those categories. Several techniques were taught including one time pad, DES, Diffieâ€“Hellman, AES and many others.
Includes Formative and Summative Assessments.

---
Designing Secure Systems - Looking at how sytem design can drastically change the function of a system and open it to a number of vulnerabilities. Theoretical topics invluded user authentication, device security,data security and metadata security.
Exams/In Class tests given with no producable artifact.
 
---
Forensics and malware analysis - Finding out how data can be traceable and the techniques in place to catch threat actors legally. With focus on subjects such as reading data without manipulation or corruption and the order in which to look at this data.
Includes Summative Assessment. 


---
Hardware and embedded systems security - Primarily using a MSP430 single board computer and the previously studied cryptography algorithms, teaching efficient implimentations with limited resources that continue to be secure was the goal of this module.
Summative Assessments included.

---
Mobile and ubiquitous computing - With the advent of technology that is so widely used in daily life, specific problems are created and so specific are needed to counteract them. Topics included context-aware systems, location-based services and research methods.
Summative Assessment included.

---
Networks - To develop understanding of TCP/IP and other networking protocols aswell as hardware and software in place at the time of study with an eye towards the future. Topics included layer models, the need for IPv6 and protocol history among many others.
Formative and Summative Assessments included.

---
Network security - Studying possible threats to network integrity, using wireshark and other network tools. Topics included firewalling, IPS/IDS, IPsec and proxies.
Summative Assessment included.

---
Penetration testing - Understanding how to enumerate and the techniques to hack systems. Topics included assembly code examination, MITM attacks, network traffic Eavesdroping and smart phone app decompilation.
Summative Assessments included.

---
Secure programming - In depth research into common classes of vulnerabilities such as the OWASP Top 10 and defences against them. Cemented with hands-on practice and defence in depth.
Formative and Summative Assessments included.

---
Secure system management - Understanding management frameworks and the policy currently in use by organisations (e.g. ISO27001). Factors of cost and risk were with respect to risk reduction and appetite.
Formative and Summative Assessments included.

---
Project - After seeing some of the effects of the recent pandemic, it was observed that phishing seemed to have a different structure than normal. This was explored in whether "disasters phishing" could be a distinct form of the attack, with research into the fields and attempts to devise a policy document that could be used in conjunction with those already in place.
Not Included at this time.
